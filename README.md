[Doc](https://docs.rs/bin-layout/)

Very fast! And flexible, This library used to serialize and deserialize data in binary format.

Inspaired by [bincode](https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode), But much more flexible.

### [Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)

By default, the library uses little endian.
If you want to use big endian, you can set `BE` features flag. And for native endian use `NE`. For example:

```toml
[dependencies]
bin-layout = { version = "5", features = ["BE"] }
```

### Example

```rust
use bin_layout::*;

#[derive(Encoder, Decoder)]
struct Car<'a> {
    name: &'a str,  // Zero-Copy deserialization
    year: u16,
    is_new: bool,
}

#[derive(Encoder, Decoder)]
struct Company<'a> { name: String, cars: Vec<Car<'a>> }

let old = Company {
    name: "Tesla".into(),
    cars: vec![
        Car { name: "Model S", year: 2018, is_new: true },
        Car { name: "Model X", year: 2019, is_new: false },
    ],
};

let bytes = old.encode();
let new: Result<_, ()> = Company::decode(&bytes);
```

There is two main reasons for this library to exists. 

### 1. ðŸš€ Performance ðŸš€  

There is no performance penalty for using this library. Or we can say there is zero-cost.

- Zero-copy deserialization:
    Its mean that no data is copied. Instead, the data is referenced.
    Which is only possible (safely) in rust, Other languages have to use unsafe operations.
    
    ```rust
    use bin_layout::*;

    #[derive(Encoder, Decoder)]
    struct Msg<'a> {
        id: u8,
        data: &'a str,
    }
    let bytes = [42, 13, 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33];
    //           ^^  ^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    //           Id  Len                         Data

    let out: Result<Msg, ErrorKind> = Msg::decode(&bytes);
    let msg = out.unwrap();

    assert_eq!(msg.id, 42);
    assert_eq!(msg.data, "Hello, World!"); // Here, data is referenced.
    ```

- Compile time allocation:

    What if the data is fixed size? Then we don't need to allocate any memory at runtime.

    For example, The following structs, don't have any dynamic data. So we can have a fixed size buffer at compile time.

    ```rust
    use bin_layout::*;
    use stack_array::ArrayBuf;

    #[derive(Encoder, Decoder)]
    struct Date {
        year: u16,
        month: u8,
        day: u8,
    }
    #[derive(Encoder, Decoder)]
    struct Record {
        id: u32,
        date: Date,
        value: [u8; 512],
    }

    let record = Record { id: 1, date: Date { year: 2018, month: 1, day: 1 }, value: [0; 512] };

    let mut arr: ArrayBuf<u8, {Record::SIZE}> = ArrayBuf::new(); // 520 bytes uninitialized memory
    record.encoder(&mut arr);
    assert_eq!(arr.len(), Record::SIZE);
    ```

    What happens if we have a dynamic data (like vector, string, etc...) ? Then we have to allocate memory at runtime.
    
    But how much memory we need to store the whole data ? When a vector is full, It creates a new vector with larger size, Then move all data to the new vector. Which is expensive.

    Well, Encoder has a method called `size_hint`, which calculates the total size of the data at runtime. Which is cheap to compute. `encode` method use `size_hint` function internaly.

    For example:

    ```rust
    use bin_layout::*;

    #[derive(Encoder, Decoder)]
    struct Student {
        roll: u32,
        name: String, // Here we have a dynamic data.
    }

    let bytes = Student { roll: 42, name: "Jui".into() }.encode();
    ```


###  Flexibility

It work by mantaining a [Cursor](https://docs.rs/bin-layout/latest/bin_layout/struct.Cursor.html). Which is a pointer to the current position in the buffer.
And the cursor is updated when reading or writing data to the buffer.

It's very easy to implement a custom serializer/deserializer for your own data type.

For example:

```rust
use bin_layout::*;

#[derive(Encoder, Decoder)]
struct Bar(u16);
struct Foo { x: u8, y: Bar }

impl Encoder for Foo {
    fn encoder(self, c: &mut impl Array<u8>) {
        self.x.encoder(c);
        self.y.encoder(c);
    }
}
impl<E: Error> Decoder<'_, E> for Foo {
    fn decoder(c: &mut Cursor<&[u8]>) -> Result<Self, E> {
        Ok(Self {
            x: u8::decoder(c)?,
            y: Bar::decoder(c)?,
        })
    }
}
```

Note: `E: Error` is required for `Decoder` trait. Because This library allow user to define your own error type. `Error` trait allow you to map internal error to your own error type.

Tips: If you don't want to use custom error type, you can use `Result<_, ()>`, Or use `bin_layout::ErrorKind` directly from this crate.

### Encoder, Decoder

All [primitive types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives.html) implement this trait.

`Vec`, `String`, `&[T]`, `&str` etc.. are encoded with their length value first, Following by each entry.

#### Variable-Length Integer Encoding

This encoding ensures that smaller integer values need fewer bytes to encode. Support types are `L2` and `L3`, both are encoded in little endian.

By default, `L2` (u15) is used to encode length (integer) for record. But you override it by setting `L3` (u22) in features flag.
 
Encoding algorithm is very straightforward, reserving one or two most significant bits of the first byte to encode rest of the length.

#### L2

|  MSB  | Length | Usable Bits | Range    |
| :---: | :----: | :---------: | :------- |
|   0   |   1    |      7      | 0..127   |
|   1   |   2    |     15      | 0..32767 |

#### L3

|  MSB  | Length | Usable Bits | Range      |
| :---: | :----: | :---------: | :--------- |
|   0   |   1    |      7      | 0..127     |
|  10   |   2    |     14      | 0..16383   |
|  11   |   3    |     22      | 0..4194303 |

 
For example, Binary representation of `0x_C0DE` is `0x_11_00000011_011110`
 
`L3(0x_C0DE)` is encoded in 3 bytes:
 
```yml
1st byte: 11_011110      # MSB is 11, so read next 2 bytes
2nd byte:        11
3rd byte:        11
```

Another example, `L3(107)` is encoded in just 1 byte:

```yml
1st byte: 0_1101011      # MSB is 0, So we don't have to read extra bytes.
```

#### Fixed-Length Integer Encoding

[Record](https://docs.rs/bin-layout/latest/bin_layout/struct.Record.html) can be used to represent fixed-size integer to represent the length of a record.

It accepts fixed-length unsigned interger type of `N` (`u8`, `u32`, `usize`, etc..) and a generic type of `T` (`Vec<T>`, `String` etc..)
